# ðŸš€ Building and Releasing a New Version

This section is for **maintainers** preparing an official new release.

## Quick Summary:

1. Build the package
2. Upload the zip to GitHub
3. (Optional) Tag the release
4. (Optional) Clean build artifacts

---

## Detailed Steps:

### 1. Build the Release Package

```bash
./scripts/build_sign_package.sh --platform=all
```

This will:
- Build macOS `.mxo` externals
- Build Windows `.mxe64` externals
- Code-sign and notarize macOS externals
- Assemble a clean `/package/` folder
- Create `ll_externals.zip` in the repo root

---

### 2. Upload the Release to GitHub

- Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/ppooll-dev/ll_externals/releases)
- Click **"Draft a new release"**
- Set:
  - **Tag:** e.g., `v1.0.0`
  - **Release title:** e.g., `ll_externals v1.0.0`
- **Attach the `ll_externals.zip` file** as the release asset.
- Click **Publish**.

---

### 3. (Optional) Bump Version and Tag Automatically

If you want to automate updating `package-info.json` and creating a Git tag:

```bash
./scripts/release.sh 1.1.0
git push
git push --tags
```

---

### 4. (Optional) Clean the Repo After Release

```bash
./scripts/clean.sh
```

This deletes:
- `build-mac/`
- `build-win/`
- `externals/`
- `package/`
- `ll_externals.zip`

---

# ðŸ§  Important Notes

- **package-info.json** defines the Max package metadata and must match the version.
- **Help patches** must exist under `/help/`.
- **Do not delete** the `/source/`, `/scripts/`, `/toolchains/`, or `/max-sdk-base/` folders unless necessary.
